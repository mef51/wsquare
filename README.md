wsquare
=======
a mini-game

__Status: Unfinished__
- tiles can be placed
- there is a character, who falls
- character won't fall through tiles
- collisions are sketchy
- development is slooow.


__Would-likes__
- break wsquare.js into pieces. Have many seperate files based on function.
- make collisions non-sketchy.
- a build script to concatenate all the files into one script.
- to finish the game! haha
